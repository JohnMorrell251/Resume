"I’m currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, focusing on areas like penetration testing, security operations, and incident response. My career has spanned various roles, each of which has helped me build a solid foundation of skills relevant to cybersecurity. As a Kennel Technician at Real Life K9, I’ve developed strong observational skills, meticulously monitoring animal health and behavior. This attention to detail is critical in cybersecurity, where identifying subtle threats and vulnerabilities can prevent major security breaches. In my role as a Petty Officer First Class in the U.S. Navy, I communicated complex information to diverse groups effectively. This ability to convey technical concepts in understandable terms is vital in cybersecurity for training and guiding non-technical stakeholders. My experience as a Rescue Lieutenant at Funston Fire Rescue involved conducting risk assessments and managing emergency responses. These skills are directly applicable to cybersecurity, where assessing risks and responding to incidents swiftly and efficiently is key. With a blend of technical training and practical experience, I am eager to contribute to the cybersecurity field, leveraging my problem-solving abilities, effective communication, and keen attention to detail to enhance security measures."
